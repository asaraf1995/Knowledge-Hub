| Reviewee's Project Name | 1. Identify and describe three strengths in this ERD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2.

How does this draft meet the requirements of the assignment? If not, what is it missing?                                                                                                                                | 4. After seeing this, I was left wondering . . .                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| knowledge_hub           | There are primary keys placed appropriately, the cardinalities look good, and the entities follow the correct naming conventions.                                                                                                                                                      | Since ID is the primary key for several entities, maybe give some a different name so it's not too confusing. There are no relationship names so it's confusing to know what the entities are doing. Also, I'm not sure if there are foreign keys or not.                                    | It follows pretty much everything on the checklist. However, the relationship names need to be added.                                                                                                                      | Is there a specific "category" of knowledge that is being added? The description was pretty vague so would it basically be like another Google or something?                                                                                               |
| knowledge_hub           | naming conventions are spot on and concise, both degree and cardinality is shown and in wonderful detail, and your database description seems to match too!                                                                                                                            | * Can one and only one user have one or many content_pages? * maybe user can be merged into content_pages (I'm probably wrong on this) * the maybe converting your attribute names to follow the TableName_AttribName norm)                                                                  | All the project components are very documented and they support how the database will be structured and designed. Trust me, I spent an hour looking for what's missing, but nothing comes to mind.                         | if you were a machine, as everything I've seen is terrific and detailed, and I definitely can't wait to see more of your project!                                                                                                                          |
